# Blog Redux

## Goodnight, Posterous

Since [posterous called it quits](http://posterous.com),  I had no choice but to revisit my blog.  I decided to take use it as an opportunity to have some fun with express, jade, stylus and git.

## Express, Jade, Stylus and Markdown

I'm totally onboard with the idea of [markdown for content](http://markdownforcontent.com/) as opposed to HTML.  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) leverages this concept quite well and served as inspiration for my home grown solution.

## Architecture

 - Express: Node.js Web App Framework
 - Jade: HAML inspired Templating Language
 - Stylus: SASS like CSS Preprocessor
 - Markdown: A more natural syntax for writing content than HTML
 - Git: Rely on Git hooks to compile and render new content
