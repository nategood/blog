# Hello World

I've finally given in.  I've joined the blogosphere.  As a young software engineer growing up in this age of social media/web 2.0/or is that 3.0/<insert cliché buzzword here>, I suppose it is my duty to have an online repository for my two cents.  Don't expect anything riveting, thought provoking, or awe inspiring.  This will most likely be a place for me to write about the mistakes I make as a maturing developer, interesting tid bits I come across, thoughts on the status quo of the interwebs, and maybe a little about the work going on at [ShowClix](http://showclix.com) from the developer's desk.
