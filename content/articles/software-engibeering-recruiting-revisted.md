# Software Engibeering: Recruiting Revisted

One of my many responsibilities at ShowClix is to recruit software
engineer folk for the team.  It's one of my favorite and yet most
frustrating tasks.  If your name isn't Google or Facebook, if you
aren't located in "the valley", if your pockets aren't infinitely
deep, recruiting talented engineers can be a challenge.

Even in a down economy software engineering remains a
["recession-proof"
job](http://www.businessinsider.com/top-10-recession-proof-jobs-2011-9-2011-9#-7).
 The good software engineers are working.  This is most evident by the
fact that the applicant list for our [Software Engineer
position](http://showclix.theresumator.com/apply/ATj6BF/FullTime-Software-Engineer.html)
is only a fraction of the size of the 800 or so new applicants
competing for our recent Customer Care Representative opening.

## The Usual Approach

There are two common options when it comes to hiring a software engineer:

*   Throw a listing out on Craigslist/Monster/Dice/Stack Overflow
Careers/Reddit Jobs and wait for the fish to bite
*   Hire a recruiting agency to do the head hunting for you

While the latter option may work great for some companies, I
personally find the business model behind recruiting agencies
fundamentally flawed (but that's for another blog article).  For this
and other reasons I tend to stay away from them.

As a result, we've historically went with the route of posting on
various free and paid job boards.  Résumés would trickle in – with
most of the candidates being what I like to call "extra mediocre".
We'd sift through the candidates, send out a ["code
puzzle"](http://sc-html.s3.amazonaws.com/puzzle.html) or setup a phone
screen with the folks we thought looked promising, and eventually
bring a couple of people in for an on-site.

The process was long, ineffective, and costly.  Hiring should be an
exciting time for a small company but with this approach it became
monotonous.  For this reason, when it came time to hire another
software engineer, we decided to try something a bit different.

## Beer Me

Instead of shelling out the $300 to $400 per job listing, we decided
we'd take that money and invest it in something that was a little more
fun: beer.  We would throw a free event for like minded tech folk in
the area to meet the ShowClix team, see the offices, and drink some
delicious local craft brew.  Seeing as we're in the business of
helping people throw successful events, we figured if anyone could
pull it off, it should be us.

### The Goals

*   Spend no more than the cost of a job listing (~$300)
*   Attract 50 local people from the Industry
*   Turn it around in one week
*   Come away with 5 to 10 really solid recruiting leads
*   Promote ShowClix as a "tech contender" in the city of Pittsburgh

### The Strategy

*   **Leverage what we've got**:  Let people see our awesome office
packed with fun perks and a great
[view](http://cl.ly/2H2Y3B2S362o3k3v3G23) of the
[city](http://cl.ly/1w133F3L2z0P0R1j3A1b) and let them meet our [young,
fun, and bright team](http://i.imgur.com/RfsrT.jpg).
*   **Get delicious local craft beer**:  There seems to be a
correlation between software engineers and drinkers of quality beer.
*   **Use our own platform to ticket it**:  Let them experience our
product first hand.  Turn on [mobile
ticketing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alleB4RxrQk) and let them
see why our product is different than what they may be accustomed to.
*   **Don't make it seem too much like a recruiting event**:  We wanted
to attract a mixed crowd of people from the tech world, including
those that weren't looking for a job.
*   **Reach out to local groups**:  We got in touch with the local
schools (CMU and University of Pittsburgh), contacted various language
specific "Meetup" groups, sent personalized emails to a handful of
local active github users, and posted on the local
[subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/pittsburgh).

## The Results

We came up just short of our goal of 50 people but were quite pleased
with the turnout.  A few of the takeaways from our engibeering event:

*   **Informal Speed Interviewing**:  Having all the candidates in one
spot let us conduct informal preliminary interviews and cut out the
need for phone screening.
*   **Relaxed Atmosphere**:  Interviews can be intimidating.  I can
recall at least one horrible interview experience with a larger tech
company where I felt so out of my element and flustered that I
completely flubbed the interview.  Getting some food and a beer or two
in your candidates should help them cool the nerves a bit.
*   **Turn Around Time**:  Going the job posting route takes a lot of
time (wait for the resumes to trickle in, review, schedule screens,
etc.).  On that night alone we were able to "screen" many qualified candidates
and walk away with several very promising leads.
*   **Street Cred**:  As we had hoped, we got a decent mix of people
actively looking for employment, people happily employed in the
industry, graduate students, and those that were just curious about
ShowClix.  As a result, we were able to further promote ShowClix as a
contender in the local tech space.
*   **A Group Thing**:  The existing software team had the chance to
meet with the candidates and play a part in deciding which candidates
we would pursue.  This is something that is usually done very late in
the interview process or sometimes not even done until the new hire
walks in on day one.  Getting the gang involved early on was a major
benefit.

All in all, we chalked it up as a win.  We met a lot of bright,
talented locals and found some quality candidates for our job opening.
 Best of all, the whole team had a ton of fun doing it.  I'm hoping
that this can become a regular occurrence.

**UPDATE** We just finished our most competitive round of hiring and we're happy to announce [@tomschlick](https://twitter.com/#!/tomschlick) will be joining the ShowClix team.  Pleased with our Engibeering experiment.  My only regret is that I couldn't hire a few more of this round's candidates.  Cheers!
